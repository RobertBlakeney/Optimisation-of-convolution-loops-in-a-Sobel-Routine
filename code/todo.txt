Multiple images at once.
(just parse an array dumbass)

Different dimensions
(need to read file dimension preperties before allocating data)????

Record IOPs and discover most computationally expensive routines
(write code for time IOPs. Use accurate clock)

Record with Register blocking

Record with vectorisation




//initialize the image
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		for (j = 0; j < M; j++)
			print[i][j] = 0;

	read_image(IN, frame1);


	GaussianBlur();
	   	  	

	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		for (j = 0; j < M; j++)
			print[i][j] = filt[i][j];

	write_image(OUT_NAME1, print);

	Sobel();



	/* write gradient to image*/

	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		for (j = 0; j < M; j++)
			print[i][j] = gradient[i][j];

	write_image(OUT_NAME2, print);
